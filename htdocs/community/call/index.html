<h1>Past Meetings</h1>

<h2 id="20200526">May 26th 2020</h2>

<p>The Genesis Release Engineering teams continue to crank out new versions of
Genesis itself and its BOSH Deployment Kits.</p>

<h3>What's Changed?</h3>

<p>A lot.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There was a breaking change to the proxy support vis-a-vis environment
variables, to accommodate odd network topology where Vault and the
jumpbox are on very different networks.  The <code>BOSH_ALL_PROXY</code> environment
variable now no longer causes Genesis to also set <code>https_proxy</code> to match.</p></li>
<li><p>The Genesis CLI now provides better feedback about <em>which</em> Vault it is
using when it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Testkit and CI/CD</h3>

<p>We are now using a homegrown testing framework for ensuring that, given an
input cloud-config, set of Genesis env files, and a kit version, we get the
expected manifest.  This is useful, insofar as it allows us to validate our
expectations from various combinations of features and parameters, without
needing to actually deploy to test.  This makes CI/CD way more powerful and
covers a lot more ground than we were able to previously, due to budgetary
constraints.</p>

<h3>Revamped Documentation</h3>

<p>Stark &amp; Wayne is looking to dedicate a technical writer to the project to
flesh out both internal and user-facing documentation, use cases, getting
started guides, etc., to improve the quality of documentation.  Thanks,
Stark &amp; Wayne!</p>

<h3>What's Coming Soon</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The BOSH 1.x Kit will soon have support for both external databases and
(s3) blobstores, as well as IAM instance metadata CPI authentication!</p></li>
<li><p>The BOSH 2.x Kit, based on the upstream <code>bosh-deployment</code>, is nearing a
release candidate, and marks a change in paradigm in how we do release
engineering for BOSH directors.  Once this goes live, our release cadence
should increase considerably.</p></li>
<li><p>The CF 2.x Kit, based on the upstream <code>cf-deployment</code> is currently
available as a release candidate, backed by a month of field experience.
Right now, all 2.x deployments have been greenfield, and we do not
recommend attempting to update a 1.x deployment to 2.x.  A migration plan
to enable that is in the works.</p></li>
<li><p>We are working on releasing the CF app-autoscaler Kit, as a standalone
deployment vehicle, for express use with the CF 2.x kit.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>What's Coming in the Far Future?</h3>

<p>James talked at length about future plans for Genesis, in a Kubernetes
world.  What happens when we <em>start</em> with a Kubernetes cluster, and then try
to deploy control plane systems, BOSH directors, and ultimately Cloud
Foundry instances?</p>

<p>The first task before us is to map current VM-based control plane systems
onto their Kubernetes equivalents.  This is pretty much a one-for-one swap
of VMs for containers.  Vault, OpenVPN, SHIELD, Prometheus, and Concourse
all have Helm charts, or at least Docker images that can be deployed to the
Kubernetes control plane.  Jumpbox is a bit weird, since it doesn't <em>do</em>
anything, but a "pause" container can do the job, and you can get in via
<code>kubectl exec</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://starkandwayne.com/gluon">Gluon</a> is a Controller for Kubernetes that
lets you deploy BOSH things via Kubernetes CRDs.  R&amp;D thinks this is a good
direction to go in -- it will allow us to support VM-based CF via BOSH, as
well as deploy other Kubernetes clusters via the <a href="https://github.com/jhunt/k8s-boshrelease">K8s BOSH
Release</a>.</p>

<p>We're still experimenting with all of these technologies in R&amp;D, and will
be focusing heavily on migration paths from current iterations of
Genesis-deployed things (via Kits).</p>

<p>This is going to be fun.</p>

<h2 id="20200421">April 21st, 2020</h2>

<p>Its been a busy first third of 2020.  Beyond the craziness of the COVID-19
situation, we've been working hard at bringing some significant changes to
Genesis and its Kits, which have been released since the last meeting in
March.  This is a summary of what was discussed during this meeting, which
lasted longer than the full hour, so we didn't get to discuss everything
that was new and upcoming, but will be touched on here in the meeting notes.</p>

<h3>Genesis v2.7.x Release</h3>

<p>Genesis v2.7.0 was <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/genesis/releases/tag/v2.7.0">released on April 9th</a>, and represents a significant
update in some major aspects of Genesis.  There are new features and well
as significant improvements to existing features.  Releases 2.7.1 through
2.7.6 followed with some bug fixes and feature enhancements in the following
days.</p>

<h4>New Feature: Kit Providers</h4>

<p>Simply put, this allows you to configure a Genesis deployment repository to
use a different source for your kits instead of the Genesis-Community GitHub
Organization.  At release, it support any other GitHub organization that
follows a release system similar to what is used by the Genesis-Community
org.  This will work for GitHub Enterprise as well, which will benefit users
that must function without access to the internet.</p>

<p>Full details can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/genesis/releases/tag/v2.7.0">2.7.0 release notes</a>, or by running <code>genesis
kit-provider -h</code> for displaying or changing it on an existing deployment
repository, or <code>genesis init -h</code> for initializing a new deployment repository.</p>

<h6>Secrets Management Refactor</h6>

<p>Secrets management has grown piecemeal over the life of Genesis, and we've
been listening to your feedback on how to make it better.  Release 2.7.0
introduced significant improvements, with some refinement being offered by
releases <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/genesis/releases/tag/v2.7.2">2.7.2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/genesis/releases/tag/v2.7.4">2.7.4</a>.  Genesis <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/genesis/releases/tag/v2.7.6">2.7.6</a> added support for managing
non-generated secrets; those secrets that are gathered during <code>genesis new</code>
and never heard from again... until now.</p>

<p>The improvements are detailed in the release notes, but a quick summary is as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Significant improvement in feedback when any of the <code>*-secrets</code> commands
are running.  There is a a progress indicator as each secret is processed in
the form of a [current/total] counter.  Each secret details the type of
secret being processed and its result.  It has a compact form that only
uses one line unless there's an error, or a verbose mode where all the
details are printed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>remove-secrets</code> has been added to allow full secrets life cycle
management, with extra functionality that will be explained below.</p></li>
<li><p><code>check-secrets</code> now validates that the secrets are correct, not just
present.  This includes X509 expiry, cert/key agreement, signing chain,
key usage and CN/SANs; public/private key agreement and size for
Diffie-Hellman, RSA and SSH; and randomly generated passwords size,
composition and alternate encoding.  Never deploy again just to find your
secrets are invalid.  It also supports levels of validation, with <code>-lm</code>
for checking for presence, <code>-li</code> for finding invalid secrets, and <code>-lp</code>
for finding problematic secrets (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>Now that we can identify invalid secrets, what to do about them.  In
earlier versions, you could just rotate all the secrets, or use <code>safe</code> to
manually remove each one that was bad.  As of 2.7.0, both <code>rotate-secrets</code>
and <code>remove-secrets</code> have added a way to remove invalid secrets.  After
some feedback on the original method of doing this, v2.7.6 solidified the
interface with a <code>-I</code> for targeting only invalid secrets, or <code>-P</code> for both
invalid or problematic (secrets that are technically different than what
the kit specifies, but potentially won't stop you from deploying, but
may become an issue in specific situations)</p></li>
<li><p><code>rotate-secrets</code> (and <code>remove-secrets</code>) provide a much finer control on
what they operate on.  Beyond the <code>-I</code> and <code>-P</code> options, you can specify exact
sub-paths (the part of the secrets path under the general secrets path for
your environment).  This will allow you to rotate/remove specific secrets.
Furthermore, you will be prompted to confirm the action, though this can
be overridden with the <code>-y</code> option.  Finally, in the ultimate form of
control, you can use the <code>-i|--interactive</code> option to step through each
secret and decide its fate.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rotate-secrets</code> loses <code>-f|--force</code> ...</p>

<p>Force option was used to rotate secrets that were "fixed", a label for
secrets that were never support to be altered.  This was selected by the
kit for secrets such as DB encryption keys, but was also applied to CA
certificates.  In practice, this was found too far reaching (all or
nothing).  To replace a fixed secret, use <code>remove-secrets</code> and add it back
using <code>add-secrets</code>.  Note: CA Certificates are no longer considered
fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>... but gains <code>--renew</code></p>

<p>CA Cert rotation was always problematic, and often provoked race condition
when trying to update all the certs that were signed by that CA.  To
resolve this, <code>rotate-secrets</code> gains the option <code>--renew</code> which keeps the
key, but generates a new certificate, with a new expiry date.  The new CA
is recognized by the certs the previous incarnation signed, so no more
race condition when rolling new certificates out.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, some love for the provided secrets.</p>

<p>When kits need to interact with external entities, it needs provided
secrets to be able to securely access them.  These are generally provided
by the <code>genesis new</code> process, but that was it for life cycle management.
As of v2.7.6, if a kit specified its usage of provided secrets under the
<code>provided</code> top-level key in its kit.yml file, all of the <code>*-secrets</code>
commands would now apply.  They could be checked, added if missing,
rotated and removed.  bosh-genesis-kit v1.10.2 was the first to ship with
this feature, and other kits will be updated to incorporate it in the near
future.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Custom Secrets Mounts</h4>

<p>Genesis has always put its secrets in a Vault directly under <code>/secrets</code>
mount, followed by a slug based on the environment name and the kit type.
Similarly, for Exodus data (the secrets that leave the environment to be
shared by other genesis environments for purpose of connectivity,
information and collaboration), it was stored under
<code>/secrets/exodus/&lt;env-name&gt;/&lt;kit-type&gt;</code>  This made it hard to use a central
corporate vault, which was sometimes required by security policy.</p>

<p>As of v2.7.0, environments could specify an alternative mount point for both
secrets and exodus data.  When creating an environment specifying
<code>--secret-mount</code> allowed you to specify an alternative base under which the
secrets of the kit would be stored (still further under the env slug and kit
type, which together can be overwritten by using the <code>--secrets-path</code>
option.  For Exodus data, the option is <code>--exodus-mount</code>, which now defaults
to <code>&lt;secrets_mount&gt;/exodus</code> but doesn't require being under the secrets
mount.</p>

<p>For existing environments, these options have corresponding keys under the
<code>genesis:</code> top-level key.  Just drop the <code>--</code> prefix and change the other
dashes to underscores: for example, <code>--secrets-mount</code> becomes
<code>secrets_mount</code></p>

<p><em>Note:</em>  While we're talking about the <code>genesis</code> block, it should be noted that
it has become the official location for Genesis-related information, while
<code>params</code> is for kit-related information.  As such, the <code>params.env</code> has been
moved to <code>genesis.env</code>, and <code>params.bosh</code> has moved to <code>genesis.bosh_env</code>.
This has been supported since v2.6.13, but any kit that specifies compliance
with v2.7.0 minimum version will expect these values in the <code>genesis</code> block.</p>

<h4>Common Root CA Certificate and Certificate Chaining</h4>

<p>Before, all generated CA certificates were self-signed, and there was no way
to specify generating a CA signed by another CA.  Genesis v2.7.0 supports
explicit signing of generated certificates as well as specifying a default
root CA certificates that will be used to sign any CA that isn't explicitly
signed in the kit.yml definition.</p>

<p>This default CA is specified by a vault path using the --root-ca-path during
a <code>new</code> operation, or by adding <code>genesis.root_ca_path</code> to an existing
environment and rotating the existing certificates.</p>

<h4>Initial Credhub Support</h4>

<p>In preparation for our v2.0.0 of cf-genesis-kit that is based on
cf-deployment, we need to be able to inter-operate with Credhub and
Credhub-based deployments.  Steps have been added to add Credhub
connectivity to the BOSH kit for facilitating login to the Credhub located
on its director VM, as well as providing Exodus data to allow other kits to
connect to it.</p>

<p>It does not yet have the full life cycle support of the <code>*-secrets</code> commands,
but that will be added as the need appears.</p>

<h4>Improved Kit Authoring.</h4>

<p>Now that we allow kits to be hosted outside of Genesis Community, we've
improved our tooling for building them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved Functionality for X509 Certificates:</p>

<p>As mentioned above, we have a more flexible signing chain specification.
By default (and previously only method), a certificate named 'ca' will be
the signing CA certificate for all sibling certificates for the given
secrets path under certificates: key in kit.yml. Alternatively, you can
specify an alternatively named certificate as the default ca for the
cohorts using the <code>is_ca</code> boolean property. Finally, you can explicitly
state another path as the signing CA certificate (relative to
environment's base secrets path) by using the <code>signed-by</code>: property.  This
allows multiple levels of CA signature chains.</p>

<p>Also mentioned above, the user can specify a root CA certificate to be
used to sign all base CAs for the kit that would otherwise be self-signed.
If you want to have an explicitly self-signed CA certificate even with the
presence of a root CA, you can ensure a CA is self-signed by providing its
own secrets path as its <code>signed-by:</code> property.</p>

<p>Can now specify <code>usage:</code> property per certificate, which takes a list of
key usage and extended key usage values. Supported usages are:
<code>digital_signature</code>, <code>non_repudiation</code>, <code>content_commitment</code>, <code>key_encipherment</code>,
<code>data_encipherment</code>, <code>key_agreement</code>, <code>key_cert_sign</code>, <code>crl_sign</code>, <code>encipher_only</code>,
<code>decipher_only</code>, <code>client_auth</code>, <code>server_auth</code>, <code>code_signing</code>, <code>email_protection</code>,
and <code>timestamping</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Parameter values in Secrets Specifications:</p>

<p>Kits can specify default values for parameter references in the form of
<code>${param.key||default value}</code></p>

<p>Kits can now specify parameter values in the secrets properties that will
be dereferenced from not only the environment, but also from the kits
manifests, albeit unevaluated. This works best for simple defaults for
parameters that can be overwritten in the environment file.</p></li>
<li><p>Check secrets integrity on compile-kit</p>

<p>When the kit is compiled with <code>genesis compile-kit</code>, it now validates all
the secrets specifications in <code>kit.yml</code>, to ensure that the end user does
not get stuck with a kit that cannot generate valid secrets.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Removed Genesis v1 Support</h4>

<p>As stated in the release notes for v2.7.0, Genesis v1 was bundled into
Genesis v2 and would be unpacked and executed if the <code>genesis</code> executable
detected that it was being run against a v1 repository.</p>

<p>Genesis v1 has not changed in over 3 years, and if you're still using v1,
you can still use genesis v2.6.x or 2.5.x releases to keep your system
working.  More importantly, if you're still using Genesis v1, we want to
know!  We'd love to help you migrate up to a v2 solution so you can take
advantage of all of its benefits.</p>

<h3>More to follow in the AM</h3>

<p>Its now midnight on the West Coast, and I wanted to make sure we got this
information out tonight.  I will continue tomorrow with the list of bugs and
minor feature enhancements the 2.7.0 line brings, along with the
improvements in the new kits, and what's to come.  I will announce in the
Genesis slack #announcements channel when this gets updated.</p>

<h2 id="20191217">December 17th, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our second community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, December 17th, 2019.</p>

<h3>New Kit Releases</h3>

<p><strong>Shield</strong> kit <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/shield-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.6.0">v1.6.0</a>
was released on December 5th, 2019, which bumps the
Shield version to <a href="https://github.com/shieldproject/shield/releases/tag/v8.6.2">v8.6.2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Minio</strong> kit v0.4.1 was released on December 5th, 2019, which bumps the
Minio version to RELEASE.2019-10-12T01-39-57Z</p>

<p><strong>Prometheus</strong> kit <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/prometheus-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1</a>
was released on December 6th, 2019, updating Prometheus version to
<a href="https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/prometheus-boshrelease/releases/tag/v26.1.0">v26.1.0</a></p>

<h3>Addendum: CF Genesis Kit Updates</h3>

<p>It was not discussed in the meeting, but <strong>cf</strong> kit has had some significant
updates since the previous Roadmap Meeting in September. <br>
It has been brought up to date with <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v9.5.0">v9.5.0 of cf-deployment release</a>
for the majority of functionality in <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.6.0">release v1.6.0</a>.</p>

<p>It has also undergone some drastic refactoring of instance groups and almost
all static IPs have been removed in preference for dynamic assignment as of
<a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.7.0">v1.7.0</a></p>

<p>Container-to-container networking and service discovery was added to v1.7.1,
and the routing api is now available as of v1.7.2.</p>

<p>There were further improvements and bug fixes -- please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases">release
notes</a> for full details.</p>

<h3>Upcoming Kit Releases</h3>

<p>We are continuing our efforts to keep cf-genesis-kit up to feature parity
with cf-deployment, with a new release based on cf-deployment v12.5.0 at the
end of 2019, or early in 2020 (before next roadmap call).  This will include
up-to-date releases, improved TLS inner workings between components, and
several other bug fixes and minor improvements.</p>

<p>Note:  We are not including the updates in v12.6.0 of cf-deployment as they
do not work in air-gapped environments.</p>

<h2 id="20190917">September 17th, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our second community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, September 17th, 2019.</p>

<h3>New Kit Releases</h3>

<p><strong>BOSH</strong> kit v1.5.0 was released on September 6th, 2019, and brings with it
a full complement of component software updates.  Notably, BOSH itself is
now at version 270.5.0, which is the latest as of today.</p>

<p>This release of BOSH deprecates some of the backwards-compatibility with
regards to naming attributed in manifest files, so a lot of other kits got
updated to accommodate.  If you want to run this, you are highly encouraged
to follow suit with your other kit deployments either before, or directly
after.</p>

<p>At a minimum, you'll need to run the following versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concourse Kit v3.6.2</li>
<li>SHIELD Kit v1.3.1</li>
<li>Cloud Foundry Kit v1.5.0</li>
<li>Vault Kit v1.5.1</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Concourse</strong> kit v3.8.0 was released on September 15th, 2019.  Notably, it
upgrades to version 5.5.1 of Concourse, which has some nice quality-of-life
improvements in the UI and worker areas.</p>

<p><strong>Jumpbox</strong> kit v1.0.5 was released on September 13th, 2019.  This release
primarily includes updates to the OpenVPN component, and software bundled
through the corresponding Jumpbox BOSH Release.</p>

<p><strong>Blacksmith</strong> kit v0.5.0 was released on September 11th, 2019, bringing
with it a new Kubernetes Forge for deploying Kubernetes clusters on-demand.
The Genesis Team is currently using this in the Stark &amp; Wayne hardware lab
to investigate new ways to break Kubernetes clusters, in an ongoing effort
to containerize more.  (We talk more about this in a bit).</p>

<h3>Upcoming Releases</h3>

<p>We are in the thick of bringing the Cloud Foundry deployment up to a more
recent vintage.  We are currently targeting mid-summer 2019 versions of all
components, but because the upstream project moves quickly and breaks things
regularly, we are proceeding cautiously.  If anyone wants to assist in the
testing of pre-release version of the kit, please shout out in the #help
channel in Slack.</p>

<h3>Moving to Container Deployments</h3>

<p>(This was an open discussion)</p>

<h2 id="20190820">August 20th, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our first ever community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, August 20th, 2019.</p>

<h3>The Website</h3>

<p>Our website (this website!), <a href="https://genesisproject.io">https://genesisproject.io</a> just got a snazzy
new redesign.  Now that the day-to-day annoyance of modifying the website
content is more well-in-hand, the team expects to start putting up more and
more blog posts and documentation!</p>

<h3>Blogs, Blogs, and More Docs!</h3>

<p>The Genesis Team has been putting forth a concerted effort to write more
approachable "first timer" content to get people interested in deploying
Cloud technology like CF, BOSH, and Kubernetes into the Genesis mindset.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by the time of our next Community Call (September 17th), we'll
have something more concrete to show off.</p>

<h3>Cloud Foundry Genesis Kit</h3>

<p>Work continues on keeping the CF Genesis Kit up-to-date with the most recent
<em>stable</em> cf-deployment upstream.  Our strategy with CF has been to follow
the upstream cf-deployment from the community, but discriminate in what we
ingest to keep with our vision of Cloud Foundry structure.</p>

<h3>CI/CD Pipelines</h3>

<p>For those interested, James showed off the internal CI/CD pipelines that the
Genesis Team uses for release engineering, and talked about the specific
challenges facing testing at-scale with so many different feature flags,
IaaS features, and user preferences.</p>

<h3>Concourse v5.4.0 Released!</h3>

<p>Lastly (but certainly not leastly) the Concourse Genesis Kit was updated to
Concourse v5.4.0! 🎉</p>
