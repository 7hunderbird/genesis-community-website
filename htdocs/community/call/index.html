<h2 id="20191217">December 17th, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our second community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, December 17th, 2019.</p>

<h3>New Kit Releases</h3>

<p><strong>Shield</strong> kit <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/shield-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.6.0">v1.6.0</a>
was released on December 5th, 2019, which bumps the
Shield version to <a href="https://github.com/shieldproject/shield/releases/tag/v8.6.2">v8.6.2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Minio</strong> kit v0.4.1 was released on December 5th, 2019, which bumps the
Minio version to RELEASE.2019-10-12T01-39-57Z</p>

<p><strong>Prometheus</strong> kit <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/prometheus-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1</a>
was released on December 6th, 2019, updating Prometheus version to
<a href="https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/prometheus-boshrelease/releases/tag/v26.1.0">v26.1.0</a></p>

<h3>Addendum: CF Genesis Kit Updates</h3>

<p>It was not discussed in the meeting, but <strong>cf</strong> kit has had some significant
updates since the previous Roadmap Meeting in September. <br>
It has been brought up to date with <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v9.5.0">v9.5.0 of cf-deployment release</a>
for the majority of functionality in <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.6.0">release v1.6.0</a>.</p>

<p>It has also undergone some drastic refactoring of instance groups and almost
all static IPs have been removed in preference for dynamic assignment as of
<a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.7.0">v1.7.0</a></p>

<p>Container-to-container networking and service discovery was added to v1.7.1,
and the routing api is now available as of v1.7.2.</p>

<p>There were further improvements and bug fixes -- please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases">release
notes</a> for full details.</p>

<h3>Upcoming Kit Releases</h3>

<p>We are continuing our efforts to keep cf-genesis-kit up to feature parity
with cf-deployment, with a new release based on cf-deployment v12.5.0 at the
end of 2019, or early in 2020 (before next roadmap call).  This will include
up-to-date releases, improved TLS interworkings betweeen components, and
several other bug fixes and minor improvements.</p>

<p>Note:  We are not including the updates in v12.6.0 of cf-deployment as they
do not work in air-gapped environments.</p>

<h2 id="20190917">September 17th, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our second community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, September 17th, 2019.</p>

<h3>New Kit Releases</h3>

<p><strong>BOSH</strong> kit v1.5.0 was released on September 6th, 2019, and brings with it
a full complement of component software updates.  Notably, BOSH itself is
now at version 270.5.0, which is the latest as of today.</p>

<p>This release of BOSH deprecates some of the backwards-compaitibility with
regards to naming attributed in manifest files, so a lot of other kits got
updated to accommodate.  If you want to run this, you are highly encouraged
to follow suit with your other kit deployments either before, or directly
after.</p>

<p>At a minimum, you'll need to run the following versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concourse Kit v3.6.2</li>
<li>SHIELD Kit v1.3.1</li>
<li>Cloud Foundry Kit v1.5.0</li>
<li>Vault Kit v1.5.1</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Concourse</strong> kit v3.8.0 was released on September 15th, 2019.  Notably, it
upgrades to version 5.5.1 of Concourse, which has some nice quality-of-life
improvements in the UI and worker areas.</p>

<p><strong>Jumpbox</strong> kit v1.0.5 was released on September 13th, 2019.  This release
primarily includes updates to the OpenVPN component, and software bundled
through the corresponding Jumpbox BOSH Release.</p>

<p><strong>Blacksmith</strong> kit v0.5.0 was released on September 11th, 2019, bringing
with it a new Kubernetes Forge for deploying Kubernetes clusters on-demand.
The Genesis Team is currently using this in the Stark &amp; Wayne hardware lab
to investigate new ways to break Kubernetes clusters, in an ongoing effort
to containerize more.  (We talk more about this in a bit).</p>

<h3>Upcoming Releases</h3>

<p>We are in the thick of bringing the Cloud Foundry deployment up to a more
recent vintage.  We are currently targeting mid-summer 2019 versions of all
components, but because the upstream project moves quickly and breaks things
regularly, we are proceeding cautiously.  If anyone wants to assist in the
testing of pre-release version of the kit, please shout out in the #help
channel in Slack.</p>

<h3>Moving to Container Deployments</h3>

<p>(This was an open discussion)</p>

<h2 id="20190820">August 20th, 2019</h2>

<p>These are the notes from our first ever community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, August 20th, 2019.</p>

<h3>The Website</h3>

<p>Our website (this website!), <a href="https://genesisproject.io">https://genesisproject.io</a> just got a snazzy
new redesign.  Now that the day-to-day annoyance of modifying the website
content is more well-in-hand, the team expects to start putting up more and
more blog posts and documentation!</p>

<h3>Blogs, Blogs, and More Docs!</h3>

<p>The Genesis Team has been putting forth a concerted effort to write more
approachable "first timer" content to get people interested in deploying
Cloud technology like CF, BOSH, and Kubernetes into the Genesis mindset.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by the time of our next Communty Call (September 17th), we'll
have something more concrete to show off.</p>

<h3>Cloud Foundry Genesis Kit</h3>

<p>Work continues on keeping the CF Genesis Kit up-to-date with the most recent
<em>stable</em> cf-deployment upstream.  Our strategy with CF has been to follow
the upstream cf-deployment from the community, but discriminate in what we
ingest to keep with our vision of Cloud Foundry structure.</p>

<h3>CI/CD Pipelines</h3>

<p>For those interested, James showed off the internal CI/CD pipelines that the
Genesis Team uses for release engineering, and talked about the specific
challenges facing testing at-scale with so many different feature flags,
IaaS features, and user preferences.</p>

<h3>Concourse v5.4.0 Released!</h3>

<p>Lastly (but certainly not leastly) the Concourse Genesis Kit was updated to
Concourse v5.4.0! 🎉</p>
