      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>BOSH is an effective way to manage your infrastructure and Azure is a great
infrastructure to manage, but before you have a BOSH director, you need to
bootstrap Azure to a point where you can deploy a BOSH Director to it.
Namely, we need an Azure app registration to use as an automation account,
a properly configured virtual network, and a virtual machine inside the
network from which we can deploy the BOSH director.</p>

<h2>Getting Azure Situated</h2>

<h3>Creating an App Registration</h3>

<p>Both Terraform and BOSH perform tasks without user input, and therefore they
require an automation account that can access the resources they need to
manipulate. Azure implements these in the form of what they call App
Registrations. In order to create one, you will need access to create
accounts in Azure Active Directory; if you do not have this access, you will
need to have somebody create the App Registration for you.</p>

<p>Once logged in, navigate to the <code>Azure Active Directory</code> on your sidebar. </p>

<p><img src="azure-active-directory.png" alt="Azure Active Directory" title=""></p>

<p>This presents a new sidebar, on which you should navigate to <code>App
registrations</code>. This will open up yet another bar - this time a horizontal
one - and you should click on <code>New registration</code> therein.</p>

<p><img src="app-registration.png" alt="App Registrations" title=""></p>

<p><img src="new-registration.png" alt="New Registration" title=""></p>

<p>Azure will ask you to provide a display name for the application, the
account type, and a redirect URI. The display name can be whatever you want
it to be. The account type will almost always be set to <code>Accounts in this
organizational directory only</code>, and the redirect URI can be left blank for
our use cases. The Redirect URI type can be set to web.</p>

<p><img src="example-app-registration.png" alt="An Example App Registration" title=""></p>

<h3>Putting Together Your Service Principal</h3>

<p>If you created the app registration in the steps above, you should be
brought to the app's overview page. Should you find yourself not on this
page, you can click on your new app in the list of app registrations in the
Azure Active Directory panel to go there.</p>

<p>To authenticate as an application, we will need to collect a few data fields
that, combined, Azure refers to as a "service principal". These include the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application ID</li>
<li>Tenant ID</li>
<li>Client Secret</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these can be gathered from the app registration's page. This overview
landing page contains the application ID and tenant ID, so take note of them
for now.</p>

<p><img src="application-tenant-id.png" alt="Application-and-Tenant-ID" title=""></p>

<p>When an app registration is first created, it does not have any client
secrets, so we'll need to create one. Navigate to <code>Certificates &amp; secrets</code>
on this pages sidebar, and then open up the creation form by clicking on
"New Client Secret". Fill in the form by setting the expiry to something
you're comfortable with. Once the form is submitted, take the client secret
that gets generated and output and note that down alongside your application
ID and Tenant ID.</p>

<img src="new-client-secret.png" alt="New Client Secret" title="">
<img src="client-secret-form.png" alt="Client Secret Form" title=""></p>

<h3>Getting Your Subscription ID</h3>

<p>We will also need the ID of the subscription that resources will be created in
(and billed to). To find the ID, search <code>Subscriptions</code> in the top bar, go to
the list of subscriptions and select the desired subscription from the list.
Copy the ID and note it down.</p>

<p><img src="subscription-id.png" alt="Subscription ID" title=""></p>

<h3>Granting Your App Registration Access to the Subscription</h3>

<p>From the subscription's overview page, you can give the application you
created access to create and manipulate resources in the target
subscription. To do so, click on <code>Access Control (IAM)</code> on the sidebar, and
then on <code>Add a role assignment</code>. Search for and select the name of the
application you previously created, and give it the role of <code>Contributor</code>.</p>

<h2>Setting up Terraform</h2>

<p>Now that we have automation credentials, we can start standing up
infrastructure using Terraform. Terraform binaries and documentation can be
found at <a href="https://terraform.io">https://terraform.io</a>.</p>

<p>We've already made a basic Terraform file for you that can stand up your
control plane if given a few extra parameters. You can set up your working
directory for terraform as follows:</p>

<pre><code>~/work/repos → git clone git@github.com:genesis-community/terraforms.git
Cloning into 'terraforms'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 26, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (26/26), done.

 ~/work/repos → mkdir terraform-work
 ~/work/repos → cp terraforms/controlplane/azure/azure.tf terraform-work/
 ~/work/repos → cp terraforms/controlplane/azure/terraform.tfvars.example terraform-work/terraform.tfvars
 ~/work/repos → cd terraform-work/
 ~/work/repos/terraform-work → terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "azurerm" (terraform-providers/azurerm) 1.32.1...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.azurerm: version = "~&gt; 1.32"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
</code></pre>

<p>Input variables for this deployment can be provided by putting their values
into the <code>terraform.tfvars</code> file. Minimally, you'll need to edit the
<code>subscription_id</code>, <code>tenant_id</code>, <code>client_id</code>, and <code>client_secret</code>.
These are all values you should have taken note earlier during the app
registration steps. </p>

<p>Once configured, run <code>terraform apply</code> from the directory with your <code>azure.tf</code> and
<code>terraform.tfvars</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>~/work/repos/terraform-work → pwd
/Users/tom/work/repos/terraform-work
~/work/repos/terraform-work → terraform apply

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

</code></pre>

<p>Following this command, Terraform will have stood up a resource group,
virtual network, network security groups, and most importantly, a bastion
box virtual machine from which you can continue your work. The terraform
script will additionally install various tools and libraries on the bastion
box that Genesis, BOSH, and Cloud Foundry need.</p>

<p>You can see from the example output above (and similarly in your actual
output) that some output variables are printed at the end of the apply.  You
will want to copy those output values somewhere for now, as they contain the
answers to many of the questions that Genesis will ask you later.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Bastion Host</h2>

<p>Once your bastion box is created, you can ssh into it to begin working from
it. The user, password, and ip address can be found in the terraform output
variables. </p>

<pre><code>~/work/repos/terraform-work → ssh ubuntu@13.82.181.177

<p>Before proceeding, you will need to set up the basics of your Git config.
Run the following with the proper values substituted:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global user.name "YOURNAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUREMAIL"
</code></pre>

<h2>Starting a Local Vault Instance</h2>

<p>Genesis stores its secrets in Vault, a piece of software written by
Hashicorp. Genesis has opinions about how the Vault should be organized,
so it's not suggested to colocate the Genesis secret store on a pre-existing
Vault.</p>

<p>We use the <a href="https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe">Safe CLI</a> to interact with
Vault in general. You should have it installed after after following the
instructions on setting up your bastion host. We're going to use Safe to
quickly set up a temporary local Vault instance that Genesis can use until we
are able to set up a permanent Vault through BOSH at a later time.</p>

<p>To do this, open a separate shell session / tmux pane on the jumpbox and run </p>

<pre><code>safe local --memory
</code></pre>

<p>Safe will output the target name of the new Vault, target it, and authenticate
to it automatically.</p>

<h2>Deploying a New Proto-BOSH</h2>

<p>First, create a <code>deployments</code> directory in which to store your various
Genesis deployment folders. Then, change to that directory and initialize
a new Genesis deployment repository:</p>

<pre><code>ubuntu@bastion:~$ mkdir ~/deployments
ubuntu@bastion:~$ cd ~/deployments
ubuntu@bastion:~/deployments$ genesis init bosh -k bosh

Select Vault:

  1) inviolable-sanctuary   (insecure) http://127.0.0.1:8201 (default)

Select choice &gt; inviolable-sanctuary

Verifying availability of selected vault...ok

Downloading Genesis kit bosh (latest version)...

Initialized empty Genesis repository in ./bosh-deployments
 - using vault at http://127.0.0.1:8201 (insecure)
 - using the bosh/1.4.0 kit.
</code></pre>

<p>Genesis will prompt you at this point about which Vault
you would like to use. Select the target that was created by <code>safe local</code>.</p>

<p><code>cd</code> into the newly created directory. Now we need to tell Genesis to
set up a new proto-BOSH director deployment. The genesis command that does
this is <code>genesis new</code>. Genesis new takes a positional argument which is the
name of the environment that you're creating the deployment in. We typically
recommend an <code>org-site-env</code> naming scheme. For the purpose of this
tutorial, we'll call ours <code>test-eastus-controlplane</code>. Once you run the
command, you'll be walked through a series of questions about the deployment
you're about to make. The answers to most of these questions were output at
the end of your <code>terraform apply</code>. Azure credential information can be found
in the <code>terraform.tfvars</code> file that you set up in your <code>terraform-work</code>
directory outside of the bastion box. An example of a successful <code>genesis new</code>
call is seen below. </p>

<pre><code>ubuntu@bastion:~/deployments$ cd bosh-deployments
ubuntu@bastion:~/deployments/bosh-deployments$ genesis new test-eastus-controlplane
Setting up new environment test-eastus-controlplane...

Using vault at http://127.0.0.1:8201.

New environment test-eastus-controlplane provisioned!

To deploy, run this:

  genesis deploy 'test-eastus-controlplane'
</code></pre>

<p>The command will then spend some time generating certificates and secrets
for the deployment to use. These will get stored in the local Vault and made
accessible by the <code>safe</code> utility.</p>

<p>An environment file named after your environment name (e.g.
<code>test-eastus-controlplane.yml</code>) will be created. This contains non-sensitive
information about your deployment. It is safe to store this file in version
control. To deploy your newly-configured BOSH deployment, you can now run:</p>

<h2>Uploading Your Cloud Config</h2>

<p>The BOSH cloud config contains shared information about all the deployments
you'll be deploying to your control plane environment. This includes the
network IP allocations, VM sizes, disk sizes, availability zone configurations,
and compilation VM configuration.</p>

<p>The terraform script, as a part of its creation of the bastion host, has put
a cloud config file for you at <code>$HOME/deployments/director-configs</code>. All you
need to do is upload it.</p>

<p>First, make sure that you're logged into bosh. Then run</p>

<pre><code>bosh -e test-eastus-controlplane update-cloud-config $HOME/deployments/director-configs/controlplane.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Now your cloud config should be uploaded and ready to go.</p>
