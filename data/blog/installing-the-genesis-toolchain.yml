There are a series of tools you'll need in order to work with Genesis. This is
a compilation of how to download and install each of those tools. Most of these
are static Go binaries, and therefore usually only require downloading the
binary and putting it into your path.

## Genesis, BOSH, Spruce, and Safe

```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkandwayne/homebrew-cf/master/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://apt.starkandwayne.com stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/starkandwayne.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install genesis
```

<a name="jq"></a>
## jq

```
sudo apt-get install jq
```

<a name="vault"></a>
## Vault

The genesis installation installs a version of Vault, but it installs it from the apt
package which is very old. 

Determine the most recent version of Vault from:

https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html

Set the `LATEST_VAULT_VERSION` environment variable as shown below and run the following commands:

```
export LATEST_VAULT_VERSION=1.1.3
wget "https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/${LATEST_VAULT_VERSION}/vault_${LATEST_VAULT_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install unzip
sudo unzip "vault_${LATEST_VAULT_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip" -d /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 0777 /usr/local/bin/vault
```

<a name="cf"></a>
## CF

While CF is not strictly required by Genesis, there's a good chance that if
you're using Genesis, you're looking at using Cloud Foundry.

```
wget -q -O - https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian/cli.cloudfoundry.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfoundry-cli.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cf-cli
```

<a name="git"></a>
## Git

You likely already have Git installed on whatever Linux box you're on. This section is a reminder
that you'll need to configure your email and name with Git in order to use it. Genesis requires
that git is configured in order to initialize a new deployment directory.

You'll need to run:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```

<a name="build-tools"></a>
## Build Tools

Your system may not have a C compiler installed by default. You'll need this in order to compile
packages for your proto BOSH. You can get the compiler tools from apt:

```
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install \
    build-essential \
    zlibc \
    zlib1g-dev \
    ruby \
    ruby-dev \
    openssl \
    libssl-dev \
```
