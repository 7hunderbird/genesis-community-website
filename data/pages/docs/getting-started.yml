# Plan The Environments

These days, several people seem to think you should be able to run a few
commands, get a BOSH director up and running, and then figure out what to do
with it.

We prefer a little more planning up-front, to save a lot of rework later on
down the line.


# A Place To Start

## Provisioning a Bastion Host

## Installing Genesis

# The Operations Tier

## Bootstrapping proto-BOSH

## Installing the Vault

## Deploying SHIELD

## A CI/CD Concourse

## Monitoring (Optional)

# Sandbox Environment

## An Environment BOSH

## Deploying Cloud Foundry

# Where To From Here?

You might want to check out the [list of available Genesis Kits][kits] to
get an idea of what else you can deploy into your infrastructure.
