## CF-M0001 Database Scheme Fix Migration

We recently discovered an issue with our CF kit that affects versions 1.1.0
to 1.1.2. TLocket and Diego databases were configured to use the database name
`postgres` by default. While this does not affect day-to-day nominal operation
of CF, we still see this an issue that needs to be corrected ASAP. **This 
process must be completed in order to update to 1.2 or above if your CF 
environments were deployed with kit versions 1.1.0, 1.1.1, or 1.1.2.**

Read the [Database Scheme Fix Migration](/docs/migrations/cf/cf-m0001)
process documentation.
