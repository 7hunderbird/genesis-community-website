# Overview

Cloud Foundry has recently improved support for secure inter-process
communications, which has been reflected in the cf-deployment release.  This
change in v1.8.0 is to better approximate the certificate tree with regards
to the CA used to sign each certificate, as well as CN and SANs used.  This
version also contains future-looking configuration to support extended key
usage that is supported but not validated currently in Cloud Foundry.

# Impact

The impact of this feature is minimal to the runtime and stability of
your Cloud Foundry deployment. It requires rotating the certificates and
associated CA certificates.  Genesis provides the tooling to do this.

There is no downtime incurred by applying this feature.

# The Process

Once you update your environment to use the v1.8.0 kit, you will need to update
your certificates.  There are two ways to do this:

## The Quick and Dirty Method

The fastest way to proceed is to regenerate all your secrets using the
`genesis rotate-secrets <env> -f` command, for your target environment.  The
`-f` option is needed to force the regeneration of the CA certs, which are 
otherwise left unrotated.

However, this has the side effect of rotating **ALL** your secrets, including
the credentials used for passwords.  This generally has no impact because these
are used internally, but if you have external tools or users that use these
credentials to interact with your deployment, you will need to propagate these
updates to your users and tools.

## The In-depth Method

If you'd rather keep your credentials, you can surgically remove just the
certificates used and add them back in using `genesis add-secrets <env>`.

All certificates generated by the `cf-genesis-kit` are stored under the
following path: 

    secret/<env-slug>/cf/<signator>/certs/<certificate>

The `<env-slug>` is your environment file name, but with hyphens converted to
slashes.  For example, if your environment file was
`mycorp-aws-uswest1-staging.yml`, the path root for this kit would be

    secret/mycorp/aws/uswest1/staging/cf/

Using this information, find the certificates using `safe` and remove them:

    path_root='secret/<env-slug>/cf/' # as described above
    for s in $(safe paths $path_root | grep '.*\/certs\/.*') ; do echo "removing $s"; safe rm -f "$s" ; done

**Warning:** Ctrl-C will not stop that command, so ensure you've correctly
entered your `path_root`.

Once that is complete, just run `genesis add-secrets <env>` to build the
required certificates.  This method is preferred as it clears out all the
old defunct certificates that are no longer used, but it doesn't hurt to
leave them in.

## Verification

As always, you can use `genesis check-secrets <env>` to verify your secrets
have been created.

# One Final Note

Genesis currently does not have the ability to have a CA certificate signed
by another CA certificate, but this is needed for the
`diego_instance_identity_ca`.  To that end, when you first run a command that
looks at building a manifest (`manifest`, `deploy`, `lookup`, `yamls`,
etc...), the blueprint hook script with check that the CA is signed
correctly, and if not, will renew it with the correct signatory CA.
