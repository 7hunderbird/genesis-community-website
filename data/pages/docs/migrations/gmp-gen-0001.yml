# Overview

The end-user's primary interface for deployments is the various environment
YAML files in the deployment repository.  Since pretty much the beginning of
Genesis 2, it has been composed of two top-level components: `kit` and
`params`.  The `kit` section identified the kit to be used and the features
to include, and the `params` block was for providing values for the kit to
use in building its manifest, with the name derived from the spruce `((
param ))` operator.  Anything outside these two blocks was merged overtop of
the manifest, allowing users to explicitly override any section of the
generate manifest.

As Genesis has evolved, we have seen the need to separate the areas of
concern from what Genesis needs to do its job (deployment, secrets
management, etc) from what the kit needs to build its manifest.  To that
end, the `genesis` block was added in v2.6.x, and values that are
Genesis-centric have been migrated there.

As of v2.7.7, continued use of the `params` versions of values that should
be found under `genesis` will generate a warning.  In prior version of the
2.7.x line, it would actually error out, and we found users were not clear
on the action needed, so we have moved to a warning and this document to
explain the impact and resolution.  It will once again become required in a
later version ov the 2.7.x line.

# Impact

The following `params` entries have been moved under `genesis`:

* `params.env` becomes `genesis.env`
* `params.bosh` becomes `genesis.bosh_env`
* `params.vault_prefix` (and the legacy `params.vault`) become `genesis.secrets_path`

# The Process

Simply edit your environment files, create a top-level `genesis` block, and
move any of the `params` entries above to the associated `genesis`
entries.

As an optional step, instead of moving, you can remove `params.vault_prefix`
or `params.vault` entries that contain the default vault path for the
environment.  This will be the environment name with all hyphens (`-`)
changed to slashes (`/`), followed by a `/<kit-type>`. For example, if my
cf-genesis-kit environment file "c-aws-dev-1.yml" had a
`params.vault_prefix` of `c/aws/dev/1/cf`, it would be safe to remove.  This
is not required, but such entries are redundant.

As always, if using pipelines, make sure you embed the new version of
Genesis in your deployment repos every time you upgrade Gensis.  This can be
done by simply running `genesis embed` inside each of your repos.
