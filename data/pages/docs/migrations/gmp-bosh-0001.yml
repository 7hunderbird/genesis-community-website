# Overview

With this release (v1.3.0), we're moving more components over to using
pre-compiled releases. However, their version numbers have not changed for
some of the releases from the previous kit version(as they represent the
same version of the software, just precompiled). This causes the manifest
release version specification methods we typically rely on to not upload the
new versions of the release if a source version of that release version is
already in your BOSH director. This causes release->stemcell mismatches. In
short, you'll need to upload these releases yourself.

# Impact

This won't break anything in your system. You'll likely just fail to deploy
initially. You may see a message such as:
```
Can't use release 'bpm/0.12.3'. It references packages without source code and are not compiled against stemcell 'bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-xenial-go_agent/170.16':
	
 - 'bpm/d139b63561eaa3893976416be9668dea539bf17d'
	
 - 'golang/27413c6b5a88ea20a24a9eed74d4b090b7b88331'
	
Can't use release 'credhub/2.0.2'. It references packages without source code and are not compiled against stemcell 'bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-xenial-go_agent/170.16':
	
 - 'configurator/d19e331ac9c867c132d19426007802f86070526a'

```
