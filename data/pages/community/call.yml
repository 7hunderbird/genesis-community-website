<h2 id="20190820">August 20th, 2018</h2>

These are the notes from our first ever community call, held at 11:00am EDT on
Tuesday, August 20th, 2019.

## The Website

Our website (this website!), <https://genesisproject.io> just got a snazzy
new redesign.  Now that the day-to-day annoyance of modifying the website
content is more well-in-hand, the team expects to start putting up more and
more blog posts and documentation!

## Blogs, Blogs, and More Docs!

The Genesis Team has been putting forth a concerted effort to write more
approachable "first timer" content to get people interested in deploying
Cloud technology like CF, BOSH, and Kubernetes into the Genesis mindset.

Hopefully, by the time of our next Communty Call (September 17th), we'll
have something more concrete to show off.

## Cloud Foundry Genesis Kit

Work continues on keeping the CF Genesis Kit up-to-date with the most recent
_stable_ cf-deployment upstream.  Our strategy with CF has been to follow
the upstream cf-deployment from the community, but discriminate in what we
ingest to keep with our vision of Cloud Foundry structure.

## CI/CD Pipelines

For those interested, James showed off the internal CI/CD pipelines that the
Genesis Team uses for release engineering, and talked about the specific
challenges facing testing at-scale with so many different feature flags,
IaaS features, and user preferences.

## Concourse v5.4.0 Released!

Lastly (but certainly not leastly) the Concourse Genesis Kit was updated to
Concourse v5.4.0! ðŸŽ‰
